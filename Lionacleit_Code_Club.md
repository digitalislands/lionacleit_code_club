# Lionacleit Library Code Club Resources

Meetings at lunchtime are short so if you want to make progress with coding then it's good if you can work on projects in your own time. Below are a list of resources. Some are lists of projects you could explore, some are online tutorials, some are tools. 

There are some coding skills that are much easier to learn in person so we'll try and focus on covering those in the library. 

As a good introduction to the concepts and syntax (the characters and words that you type to make things happen) of python the Sololearn site has a good course that will explain things. 
If you want to look up a particular thing; how to use strings for example, then the W3Schools site is great for showing how to use each feature of the language. 

If you just want to write programs then the Raspberry Pi foundation projects page is great. The instructions are clear and you can find links to complete versions of the code at the bottom of the page. (usually a link to a github page)



# Raspberry Pi Foundation

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en

Raspberry Pi Python Course (starting with very easy projects and going on from there)

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/python-module-1

All Raspberry Pi Projects (includes lots of physical computing projects)

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects



# Sololearn

There are various courses on this website for different programming languages, including Python and Javascript. 
https://www.sololearn.com/


# W3 Schools Python Tutorial

Lots of clear explanations of the various aspects of the Python programming language.

# Atom

https://atom.io/

This code editor is open source and free. This is the one we've used in the library

Alternative code editors that are free to download include Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code and Intelij. Some of these are pretty fancy and could be confusing when you're starting out. Go for Visual Studio (free microsoft application) if you're looking for an alternative to Atom (or Python's IDLE).

# Online Python Editor

Below are some options for writing and running code online (in Python) if, for some reason, you can't get things working on your own computer. 

This is an online Python editor:

https://repl.it/languages/python3 

Online python shell: (this is a python environment where you write the code straight into the terminal, rather than writing a file that you then tell the shell to run: that's what the command: 
python your_file_name.py 
does)

https://www.python.org/shell/

If you want to program a microbit using python you can use this online editor:
